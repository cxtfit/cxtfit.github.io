<h4>Section 11: Use of CXTFIT/Excel in Excel 2007 or 2010</h4>

In addition to a different graphic user interface (GUI), Excel 2007 uses a different Solver Add-In (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\Library\SOLVER\SOLVER.XLAM) from Excel 2003 (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office11\Library\SOLVER\SOLVER.XLA). An Excel 2007 file (CXTFIT.xlsm) is provided for Excel 2007 users. When Macros is enabled and the Solver Add-In is loaded, the use of CXTFIT/Excel in Excel 2007 is similar to that in Excel 2003. The CXTFIT menu is in the Add-Ins tab. Defining the Excel range or constant name is a little easier in Excel 2007 by using the Name Manager in the Formulas tab. The following procedure from Excel Help is for loading the Solver Add-In:

<ol>

<li>Click the <b>Microsoft Office Button</b>, and then click <b>Excel Options</b></li>

<p><li>Click <b>Add-Ins</b>, and then in the <b>Manage</b> box, Select <b>Excel Add-Ins</b></li></p>

<p><li>Click <b>Go</b></li></p>

<p><li>In the <b>Add-Ins available</b> box, select the <b>Solver Add-In</b> check box, and then click <b>OK</b></li></p>

<p>Tip: If <b>Solver Add-In</b> is not listed in the <b>Add-Ins available</b> box, click <b>Browse</b> and locate the add-in.</p>

<p>If you get prompted that the <b>Solver Add-In</b> is not currently installed on your computer, click <b>Yes</b> to install it.</p>

<p><li>After you load the <b>Solver Add-In</b>, the <b>Solver</b> command is available in the <b>Analysis</b> group on the <b>Data</b> tab</li></p>

<p>Users may also need to open CXTFIT/Excel files in Excel 2003. When both Excel 2003 and Excel 2007 are installed, and the Solver Add-In is properly loaded in Excel 2003, Excel 2007 may use the Excel 2003 Solver Add-In. In that case, both the CXTFIT menu and Solver are in the Add-Ins tab.</p>

<p>If Excel 2007 can not access the Excel 2003 Solver Add-In, users will need to replace the Solver Add-Ins after opening the Excel 2003 file. By default the Solver should be loaded in Excel 2007, and then follow Step 5 in <a href="section10.html">Section 10</a> to replace the Solver Add-Ins (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\Library\SOLVER\SOLVER.XLAM).</p>

<p>Similarly, when Excel 2003 is used to open the Excel 2007 file, users need to replace the Excel 2003 Solver Add-In.</p>
